# Test_Front-end
Front end (HTML, CSS, JS) test for http://www.rythm.co/



# Front-end internship exercise 

## Objective 

Build a web page matching the attached mockup and the specifications below.

## Constraints

* Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.
* Targets are evergreen browsers.

## Specifications 

* Space between the menu elements are identical.
* The menu is horizontally centered.
* When hovering a menu element, the other elements should animate to a 0.3 opacity, preferrably without any JS.
* The button on the top right has the same baseline as the menu but is aligned to the right (without altering the centering of the menu).
* The square in the center has a red gradient background. It should slide-in from the outside of the screen to its centered position on page initial load. 
* The button below the square should be aligned with it. A click should trigger a vertical bounce animation on the square, preferrably using a CSS Animation.
* The square + button block should be both vertically and horizontally centered.
* Responsiveness is a bonus but would be greatly appreciated.

## Format

A git repository is recommended however simple HTML/CSS/JS files are fine.
